The ultimate food adventurer with hilariously low standards. Known among friends to never turn away an unfamiliar dish, BanditEcho celebrates what elevates food to greatness and, curiously, what diminishes its appeal. Guilty pleasures include sickeningly sweet general tso's chicken, mayonnaise sandwiches, and steamed rice + potato chips.

Motto: "If it's edible, it's enjoyable."
