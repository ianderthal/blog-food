### Grab the earliest flight out of MI to be first in line for dim sum in NYC.

On the third floor of a building proudly displaying its name, Golden Unicorn in Chinatown was our first stop. This meal was quick, digging into the food immediately after being seated (the women pushing the carts had no problem with me pointing and nodding). Start to finish, only 30 minutes. A tad more luxurious than usual - $70 for two people.
