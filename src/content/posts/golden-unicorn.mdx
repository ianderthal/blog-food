<h2 class="h3 leading-tight">
  Grab the earliest flight out of Michigan to be first in line for dim sum at
  Golden Unicorn in NYC.
</h2>

On the third floor of a building proudly displaying its name, Golden Unicorn in Chinatown was our first stop on our Memorial Day weekend. The women pushing the carts had no problem with me pointing and nodding at what I wanted to devour next. Steamed bao, bean curd, congee with century egg. This meal was quick. Start to finish, only 30 minutes. A tad more luxurious than usual - $70 for two people.
