<h2 class="h3 leading-tight">You can't visit without grabbing a couple.</h2>

Waking up early and hustling out of the hotel only to find a line already formed out the front door! After answering a dozen questions from the very patient employee ("What kind of bagel? Toasted? Cream cheese? What flavor? Cut in half? How do you want the egg?"), I slinked back to the room with 2 sandwiches and 2 coffes. 

Being a morning person has its perks.
